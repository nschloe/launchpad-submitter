Description: multiphysics assembly engine for solving large-scale PDE systems
 Panzer is a tool kit for multiphysics PDE assembly. It is physics agnostic.
 Using this package, a user can define high level equation sets for multiphysics
 systems.  The library then generates a Thyra::ModelEvaluator for a fully
 coupled implicit system that can be then handed off to Trilinos linear and
 nonlinear solvers.  Panzer is a toolkit so users do not have to buy into the
 complete infrastructure. For example, panzer provides a stand-alone degree of
 freedom manager that provides a unique global indexing given the mesh
 connectivity and the degree of feedom patterns in each element block. This
 allows for different degrees of freedom/equation sets in each mesh element
 block of a coupled system and allows for mixed basis within each element block.
 Additionally, Panzer contains machinery for evaluating individual operator
 contributions so that block decomposed and physics-based preconditioners can be
 efficiently constructed.  Panzer also contains the adapters to support STK mesh
 and SEACAS/Exodus formats.

Package: libtrilinos-shylu12

Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: solving sparse linear systems
 ShyLU is a package for solving sparse linear systems. It can be used either as
 a preconditioner, or as a solver. Currently, we recommend using it as an
 Ifpack preconditioner. ShyLU uses a hybrid direct/iterative approach based on
 Schur complements. The goal is to provide robustness similar to sparse direct
 solvers, but memory usage more similar to preconditioned iterative solvers.
 ShyLU was designed as a node-level solver. It can use both MPI and threads in
 several ways. ShyLU was designed (a) to solve difficult but medium-size
 problems, and (b) to be used as a subdomain solver or smoother for very large
 problems within an iterative scheme. It is a purely algebraic method so can be
 used as a black-box solver. ShyLU has been particularly successful in
 electrical circuit simulation (Xyce).
