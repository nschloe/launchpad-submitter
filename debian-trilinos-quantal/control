Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: libtrilinos-doc
Description: object-oriented framework for large-scale problems
 The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling
 technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the
 solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and
 scientific problems. A unique design feature of Trilinos is its
 focus on packages.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic libraries.

# We don't actually need all of the following dependencies. A bug in Trilinos
# <https://software.sandia.gov/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6082> however makes it
# necessary for the dependent dev-packages to be installed alongside
# libtrilinos-dev.
# The dependency on libboost-system-dev is a consequency of Boost bug #7085,
# cf. <https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7085>.
