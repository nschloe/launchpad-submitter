Package: libtrilinos
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: libtrilinos-doc
Description: object-oriented framework for large-scale problems
 The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling
 technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the
 solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and
 scientific problems. A unique design feature of Trilinos is its
 focus on packages.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic libraries.
